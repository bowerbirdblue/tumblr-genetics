Inspired by the tumblr blog hellsitegenetics! When it's done, you should be able to input text, which the program will then regex (regular expression) for the characters A, C, T, and G. The program will take the regexed string and run NCBI's BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) (via Biopython) and give you the most closely matching sequence + the organism it belongs to.
